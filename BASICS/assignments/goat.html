    <h1>Goat</h1>
    <h2>Specialties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Milk Production:</strong> Goats are prolific milk producers and
        are often raised for their milk, which is consumed directly or used to
        make various dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and butter. Certain
        goat breeds, like the Saanen and Alpine, are particularly known for
        their high milk yield.

      <li>
        <strong>Fiber Production:</strong> Certain breeds of goats, such as
        Angora and Cashmere goats, are raised for their fiber. Angora goats
        produce mohair, a luxurious and silky fiber used in high-end textiles
        and clothing, while Cashmere goats produce cashmere wool, renowned for
        its softness and warmth.

        <strong>Brush Clearing:</strong> Goats are excellent browsers and are
        often employed for vegetation management, particularly in areas with
        dense vegetation or invasive plant species. Their browsing habits help
        clear out unwanted vegetation, making them valuable for land management
        and conservation purposes. This practice is known as "goat grazing" or
        "prescribed grazing."

      <h2>3 Intresting fact About Goat</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Wide Variety of Breeds:</strong> Goats come in many different
          breeds, each with its own unique characteristics. From the small and
          hardy Nigerian Dwarf goat to the large and majestic Boer goat, there's
          a goat breed suited for various purposes, including meat, milk, and
          fiber production.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Excellent Climbers:</strong> Goats are exceptional climbers
          and have a natural instinct to scale steep and rocky terrain. Their
          agility and surefootedness enable them to navigate mountainous
          landscapes with ease. They use their keen sense of balance and
          flexible hooves to traverse steep slopes and rocky outcrops, making
          them adept at reaching vegetation that other grazing animals might not
          access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex Social Structure:</strong> Goats are social animals that form intricate
          social hierarchies within their herds. They establish dominance
          through displays of aggression, such as head-butting and horn locking,
          but also engage in affiliative behaviors like grooming and leaning on
          each other. Understanding and respecting the social dynamics within a
          goat herd is essential for their management and welfare.
