    <h2>Specialties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Companionship:</strong> Dogs are renowned for their loyalty and
        companionship to humans. They have been domesticated for thousands of
        years and have evolved alongside humans as trusted companions. Dogs
        provide emotional support, companionship, and often serve as therapy
        animals, offering comfort and assistance to people in various settings,
        including hospitals, nursing homes, and schools.

        <strong>Working Roles:</strong> Dogs have a long history of working
        alongside humans in various capacities. They serve in roles such as
        herding livestock, guarding property, assisting in hunting, and even
        pulling sleds. Different breeds have been selectively bred for specific
        tasks, resulting in a wide range of working abilities and skills. For
        example, Border Collies excel at herding sheep, while German Shepherds
        are commonly used as police and military dogs.

        <strong>Service and Assistance:</strong> Dogs play crucial roles in
        providing assistance and support to people with disabilities. Service
        dogs are specially trained to assist individuals with physical or mental
        disabilities, performing tasks such as guiding the visually impaired,
        alerting the deaf to sounds, providing mobility assistance, and even
        detecting medical conditions like seizures or low blood sugar. These
        dogs greatly enhance the independence and quality of life of their human
        partners.

    <h2>3 Intresting fact About Dog</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Diverse Breeds:</strong> Dogs are one of the most diverse
        species in terms of breeds, with hundreds of different breeds recognized
        worldwide. Despite this incredible diversity, all domestic dogs belong
        to the same species, Canis lupus familiaris. From the tiny Chihuahua to
        the towering Great Dane, dogs exhibit an astounding variety of sizes,
        shapes, coat types, and temperaments.

        <strong>Superior Sense of Smell:</strong> Dogs have an exceptional sense
        of smell, far surpassing that of humans. Their olfactory capabilities
        are estimated to be tens of thousands to even hundreds of thousands of
        times more sensitive than ours. This remarkable sense of smell enables
        dogs to detect scents with incredible accuracy and can be harnessed for
        various tasks, including search and rescue, detection of explosives and
        narcotics, and even medical diagnosis, such as detecting cancer or
        impending seizures.

        <strong>Tail Wagging Communication:</strong> While dogs use a variety of
        vocalizations to communicate, their body language, particularly tail
        wagging, is also a significant form of communication. Contrary to
        popular belief, a wagging tail doesn't always indicate friendliness or
        happiness. The position, speed, and direction of the wag can convey
        different messages. For example, a rapid wagging tail held high often
        indicates excitement or confidence, while a slow wag with the tail held
        low may signal apprehension or submission. Paying attention to a dog's
        tail language can provide valuable insights into their emotional state.
