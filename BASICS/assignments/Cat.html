    <h1>Cat</h1>
    <h2>Specialties</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Hunting Skills:</strong> Cats are natural-born hunters with
        exceptional predatory instincts. They possess keen senses of sight,
        hearing, and smell, which they use to stalk and capture prey. Their
        agile bodies, sharp claws, and teeth are well-suited for hunting small
        mammals, birds, insects, and other prey. Cats' hunting abilities not
        only serve as a means of obtaining food but also provide them with
        mental stimulation and physical exercise.

        <strong>Self-Grooming:</strong> Cats are famously fastidious groomers
        and spend a significant amount of time each day grooming themselves.
        Their rough tongues act like combs, removing dirt, loose fur, and
        parasites from their coats. In addition to keeping their fur clean and
        free of tangles, grooming also helps regulate body temperature and
        stimulate circulation. Cats' grooming behavior is not only a practical
        necessity but also serves as a form of relaxation and self-care.

        <strong>Agility and Acrobatics:</strong> Cats are renowned for their
        agility, grace, and acrobatic abilities. They are capable of remarkable
        feats of athleticism, including jumping, climbing, and balancing with
        remarkable precision. Cats' flexible spines, powerful leg muscles, and
        keen sense of balance enable them to navigate challenging environments
        with ease, whether it's scaling trees, leaping across gaps, or perching
        on narrow ledges. Their natural agility allows them to explore their
        surroundings and evade potential threats effectively.

            <strong>Purring for More Than Happiness:</strong> While cats often purr when they're content, purring can also serve other purposes. Some research suggests that cats may purr to self-soothe or to calm themselves in stressful situations. Additionally, mother cats purr to communicate with their kittens, helping them find their way to her for nursing. Purring is also believed to have therapeutic effects, both for cats and humans, as the frequency of a cat's purr has been found to promote healing and reduce stress.

            <strong>Whiskers as Sensors:</strong> Cats' whiskers, also known as vibrissae, are highly sensitive tactile hairs that play a crucial role in their sensory perception. They are deeply embedded in the cat's skin and are connected to nerves that provide sensory information to the brain. Whiskers help cats navigate their environment by detecting changes in air currents, determining the size and shape of objects, and gauging distances. They also serve as indicators of a cat's mood and intentions, as whiskers can be pushed forward when a cat is curious or pulled back when they are frightened or agitated.

            <strong>Communication Through Tail Movement:</strong> Cats communicate a lot through their tails, and the positioning and movement of their tails can convey various emotions and intentions. For example, a cat with an upright tail that is slightly curved at the tip may be feeling confident and friendly, while a tail held low or tucked between the legs can indicate fear or submission. A twitching tail can signal excitement or agitation, while a slow swish may indicate annoyance or impatience. Understanding a cat's tail language can provide valuable insights into their mood and behavior.
